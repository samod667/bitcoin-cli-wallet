# Bitcoin Address Generation CLI

A simple Python command-line tool to generate testnet Bitcoin addresses. It can:
- Generate a random base private key with a BIP-39 mnemonic (24 words).
- Accept a user-provided testnet private key (WIF format).
- Derive 10 additional testnet addresses from the base key.
- Display results in a clean table format.

Built as a learning project to explore Bitcoin key generation and derivation.

## Features
- Generates a 24-word BIP-39 mnemonic for random keys.
- Outputs private keys (WIF), public keys (hex), and testnet addresses.
- Basic error handling for invalid inputs or mainnet keys.
- Simple derivation by incrementing the base private key (not full BIP-32).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- A virtual environment (recommended)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bitcoin-address-generation-cli.git
   cd bitcoin-address-generation-cli
Set up a virtual environment:
bash
Wrap
Copy
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
Install dependencies:
bash
Wrap
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the script with or without a private key:

Generate random keys with mnemonic:
bash
Wrap
Copy
python generate_address.py
Use a specific testnet private key:
bash

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes
The derivation method is simplified (adds an index to the base key) and not cryptographically secure for real use. For production, use BIP-32/44 HD wallets.
Only supports testnet addresses (keys starting with c).
Error handling covers invalid WIF formats and mainnet keys.

### Step 4: Push the README to GitHub
Add and commit the README, then push it:
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README with setup and usage instructions"
git push origin main

text
Wrap
Copy

---

### Step 5: Verify on GitHub
- Visit your repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/<your-username>/bitcoin-address-generation-cli`).
- Check that the README renders nicely, and all files (`generate_address.py`, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`) are there.
- The README should appear as the main page with formatted sections.

---

### Step 6: Share It!
- Tweet it out with `#BitcoinDev` if you’d like:
Just built a Python CLI tool to generate testnet Bitcoin addresses with mnemonics! Check it out: https://github.com/<your-username>/bitcoin-address-generation-cli #BitcoinDev

### Checkpoint
- Did the Git setup and push work? Any errors (e.g., authentication issues)?
- Does the README look good on GitHub? Want to tweak anything (e.g., add more details, screenshots)?
- Note: If your file is `generate-address.py` (with dashes), update the README commands to match (`python generate-address.py`).

Let me know how it goes or if you need help with any part! Once it’s up, you’ve got a polished project to share. What’s next—tweaking the code more, or something else?





can you show me the complete readme.md file ? 


Here’s the complete README.md file tailored for your bitcoin-address-generation-cli project. I’ve ensured it reflects the exact functionality of your script (including the mnemonic words, 10 derived addresses, and error handling) and follows good Markdown formatting for GitHub. I’ve also assumed the file is named generate_address.py (with underscores) since that’s what we’ve been using consistently—let me know if you’ve renamed it to generate-address.py (with dashes), and I’ll adjust accordingly.

# Bitcoin Address Generation CLI

A simple Python command-line tool to generate testnet Bitcoin addresses. It can:
- Generate a random base private key with a 24-word BIP-39 mnemonic when no input is provided.
- Accept a user-provided testnet private key in Wallet Import Format (WIF).
- Derive 10 additional testnet addresses from the base private key.
- Display results in a formatted table, including private keys, public keys, addresses, and mnemonic words (if applicable).

This project was built as a learning challenge to explore Bitcoin key generation, mnemonic seeds, and basic derivation in Python.

## Features
- Generates a 24-word BIP-39 mnemonic for random keys (256-bit entropy).
- Outputs private keys (WIF), public keys (hex), and testnet addresses in a clean CLI table.
- Derives 10 child keys by incrementing the base private key (simplified, not full BIP-32).
- Includes error handling for invalid WIF formats, mainnet keys, and derivation issues.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- A virtual environment (recommended)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bitcoin-address-generation-cli.git
   cd bitcoin-address-generation-cli
Set up a virtual environment:
bash
Wrap
Copy
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
Install dependencies:
bash
Wrap
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the script with or without a private key argument:

Generate a random key with mnemonic:
bash
Wrap
Copy
python generate_address.py
Use a specific testnet private key:
bash
Wrap
Copy
python generate_address.py cN9s...

Error Example

text
Wrap
Copy
Error: Invalid private key format or unexpected issue (Invalid base58 string)
Notes
Derivation: The tool uses a simplified method (incrementing the base private key integer) for educational purposes. It’s not cryptographically secure or BIP-32 compliant. For real-world use, implement proper HD wallet derivation (e.g., m/44'/1'/0'/0/[0-9]).
Testnet Only: Supports testnet private keys (starting with c). Mainnet keys (e.g., starting with 5, K, or L) will trigger an error.
Security: This is a learning project—do not use generated keys for real Bitcoin funds.

### Notes About the README
- **Username Placeholder**: Replace `<your-username>` with your actual GitHub username in the clone URL.
- **Filename**: I used `generate_address.py` (underscores) as the script name in the usage examples, matching our earlier steps. If you’ve saved it as `generate-address.py` (dashes), update the commands to `python generate-address.py`.
- **Content**: It covers setup, usage, example outputs (including error cases), and disclaimers about the simplified derivation.
- **Tone**: Keeps it clear and beginner-friendly, with a nod to your learning journey.

### Next Steps
1. Save this as `README.md` in your `bitcoin-address-generation-cli` folder.
2. Commit and push it:
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add detailed README"
git push origin main
